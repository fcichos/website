Lecture Contents
================

Lecture 8 will be probably the shortes. We have more or less our "Bergfest" today. Therefore, I wont stress you with 1.5 hours of video lecture but rather only 50 min. Well this might be also enough. Today we cover curve fitting

1. Curve fitting in Python
2. Least Squares
3. Covariances and Correlation 

I hope you stay motivated over time! Stay safe!
