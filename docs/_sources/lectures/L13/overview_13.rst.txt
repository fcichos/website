Lecture Contents
================

Lecture 13 is all about Neural Networks. We will create a neural network in Python from the scratch to classify handwritten numbers. This is one of the standard problems you find. In the second part of the lecture we will do the same with the keras and tensorflow modules in Python. You will recognize, by how much these networks simplify the construction of machine learning applications. This lecture has been largely created by Martin Fränzl.

1. Neural Networks (MNIST)
2. Neural Networks with Keras (MNIST)

The video will this time come a bit later. As I saw that most of you are still behind with some of the other videos :-), this may be a welcome thing.
