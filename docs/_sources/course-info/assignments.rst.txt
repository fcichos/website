Assignments
============

The lecture will be held completely online this year. We will supply also the problem sets every week to all students. The assignments come as a Jupyter Notebook, with individual problems. Please fill in the code or answers your are asked for and return the notebooks **before the lecture** every Tuesday morning. You will receive the web address of our assignment server as well as a login and password. Find also below a short video on how to download and return the assignments.
